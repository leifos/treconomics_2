          <p> <h1> News Search System Study </h1></p>

        <p>
        This HIT involves performing four search tasks of approx. 5-10 minutes each using four Newspaper search engines.
        For each search task, you will be given a topic, such as: </p>
        <div id="taskbox" style="padding:5px">
            Find and bookmark articles that discuss instances of piracy,
            where DIFFERENT BOATS/SHIPS have been illegally taken control of or boarded.
        </div>
        <p>
    After each search task, you will be asked to recall aspects of what you found. In the above, example, the different boats/ships involved.
    This will be
 followed by a series of short survey questions
        asking you about the difficulty of the topic, your search experience and the performance of each search engine.
        <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
             The HIT will stat with a short demographics survey and perceptual speed test (2 minutes)  you will have the chance to undertake a short practice task (5 minutes max), where you can decide to continue or not.
