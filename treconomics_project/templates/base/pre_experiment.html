    <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>

    <p>
        First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this
        experiment about searching for news.<br/>

        Beforehand, you'll first complete a short visual perception test.
        Then, during the main experiment, we would like you to perform four different search tasks
        (and a practice task) using our news search system.
    </p>


<!--    #I think this bit below needs to come after the PS test.&#45;&#45;Olivia-->

    <h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
    <p>Imagine that you are taking a journalist class and need to write a number of short posts/articles
            on various topics.
    </p>
        <p>
            To provide the evidence for your articles,
            you need to find several different examples for each topic to demonstrate
            your understanding about the topic.

        </p>


    <h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <p>The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1 million newspaper articles from the
            <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Xinhua</em> news agencies. The articles
            within the database range from 1996 to 2000. The search system you'll be using looks similar to a web search
            engine, such as Google.
    </p>
    <h2><b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <p>
        For each search task, you'll be given a topic that contains information that would be relevant to search for.
        This can be viewed by the <b>Show Task</b> button
            at the top right-hand corner of the screen.

        </p>
    <p>
        You will be able to enter queries and look at results, just like you would in a normal search engine.
            When viewing a document, you can select the <b>Bookmark</b> button to mark it as relevant.
    </p>
<p>
         A relevant document should meet the specified criteria and help you to provide evidence for your article.

        After searching, you will be asked to list as many examples as possible that you have just found.

        </p>

    <h2><b>Goal</b></h2>
       <p> <b>Your goal is to find and save several relevant and different examples for each topic </b>
        </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2><b>Experiment Outline</b></h2>
        <p>The experiment should take approximately one hour in total i.e. about 10 minutes per task.</p>


    <p> Before you start searching, we will ask you a few questions about you.</p>

    <p>We will then give you a few minutes to get comfortable with the system by undertaking a <b>practice
        task.</b></p>

    <p>You'll then move onto the <b>four individual main search tasks</b>.

        Before each task, you will complete a
        <b>pre-task questionnaire</b>
        about your knowledge of the search topic.

        After you complete the task, you will complete a
        <b>post-task questionnaire</b> about the search experience.</p>

<p> At the end of the experiment, there will be one final questionnaire about your overall experience. </p>

    <hr/>
    <h2><b>Confirmation of Participation and Commitment</b></h2>

    <p> If you have any questions, please ask the researcher now. Please remember that the data you provide will be
        anonymous, and will be used only for the purposes of this study.</p>
