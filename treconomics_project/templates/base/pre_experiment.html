    <h1> Study Instructions </h1>

    <h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
    <p>For this study, imagine that you are taking a <b>journalist class</b> and need to write a number of news stories
            on various topics.
    </p>
        <p>
            To provide the evidence for your news stories,
            you need to search and find several different news articles that contain examples relevant to each topic.
            These articles and examples will demonstrate your knowledge about the topic.
        </p>

    <p> As part of the study you will be using our <b>News Search Engine</b> that connects to the New York Times database from 1987-2007. </p>

       <p> <b>Your goal is to find and save several relevant and different documents and then list the examples for each topic. </b>
        </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2><b>Study Outline</b></h2>
    <p>The study should take <b>approximately one hour and twenty minutes</b> in total.</p>

    <p> The study will consist of the following stages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Short Demographics Questionnaire</b> (2 min)</li>
        <li> <b>Practice Search Task</b> (5 mins)</li>

<!--
  <p>
        First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this
        study about searching for news.<br/>

        Beforehand, you'll first complete a short visual perception test.
        Then, during the main experiment, we would like you to perform four different search tasks
        (and a practice task) using our news search system. </p>

-->

<!--    #I think this bit below needs to come after the PS test.&#45;&#45;Olivia-->



    <!--
    <p> Before you start searching, we will ask you a few questions about you.</p>

    <p>We will then give you a few minutes to get comfortable with the system by undertaking a <b>practice
        task.</b></p>

    <p>You'll then move onto the <b>four individual main search tasks</b>.

        Before each task, you will complete a
        <b>pre-task questionnaire</b>
        about your knowledge of the search topic.

        After you complete the task, you will complete a
        <b>post-task questionnaire</b> about the search experience.</p>

<p> At the end of the experiment, there will be one final questionnaire about your overall experience. </p>
-->


 <!--
    <h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <p>The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1.8 million newspaper articles from the
            <em>New York Times</em>. The articles within the database range from 1987 to 2007.
        The search system you'll be using looks similar to a web search
            engine.
    </p>
    <h2><b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <p>
        For each search task, you'll be given a topic that contains information that would be relevant to search for.
        This can be viewed by the <b>Show Task</b> button
            at the top right-hand corner of the screen.

        </p>
    <p>
        You will be able to enter queries and look at results, just like you would in a normal search engine.
            When viewing a document, you can select the <b>Bookmark</b> button to mark it as relevant.
    </p>
<p>
         A relevant document should meet the specified criteria and help you to provide evidence for your article.

        After searching, you will be asked to list as many examples as possible that you have just found.

        </p>
