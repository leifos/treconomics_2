    <p> <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1></p>

    <p>
        First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this experiment about online
        searching!<br/>
        During this experiment we would like you to perform four different search tasks (and a practice task)
        using the same search system.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For this experiment, imagine that you heard about an interesting topic in the news,
            and you want to find out more information about this topic in order to write a blog post about it.
            In order to accomplish this you will need to search for related information to find relevant documents that
            will help you write your blog.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1 million newspaper articles from the
            <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Xinhua</em> news agencies. The articles
            within the database range from 1999 to 2000. The search system you'll be using looks similar to a web search
            engine, such as Google.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For each search task, you'll be given a short description of a topic and a clue at what kind of
            information would be relevant to this topic. This can be viewed by the <b>Show Task</b> button
            at the top right-hand corner of the screen.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>You will pose queries and look at results, just like you would in Google. When
            viewing documents, you can select the <b>Mark as Relevant</b> button when you find a document relevant to
            the topic. A relevant document would be one which you think could hypothetically help you to write your blog.
            There are <b>over 100 relevant documents</b> in the database for each topic.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2><b>Goal and Incentive</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As previously mentioned, <b>your goal is to find a range of different examples so you can provide a
        balanced view of the topic.</b>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The experiment should take approximately 1 hour</strong></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2><b>Experiment Outline</b></h2>
    <p> Before you start searching, we will ask you a few questions about you.</p>

    <p>We will then give you a few minutes to get comfortable with the screen by undertaking a <b>practice
        task.</b></p>

    <p>You'll then move onto the <b>four individual main search tasks</b>.

        Before each task, you will complete a
        <b>pre-task questionnaire</b>
        about your knowledge of the search topic.

        After you complete the task, you will complete a
        <b>post-task questionnaire</b> about the search experience.</p>

<p> At the end of the experiment, there will be one final questionnaire about your overall experience. </p>

    <hr/>
    <h2><b>Confirmation of Participation and Commitment</b></h2>

    <p> If you have any questions, please ask the researcher now. Please remember that the data you provide will be
        anonymous, and will be used only for the purposes of this study.</p>
