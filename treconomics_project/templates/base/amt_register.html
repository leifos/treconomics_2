         <p> <h1> News Search System Study </h1></p>

        <p>
        This HIT involves performing four search tasks of approx. 10 minutes each using a Newspaper based search engine.
        </p>

        <p>For each search task, you will be given a topic, such as: </p>
        <div id="taskbox">
            Find and bookmark articles that discuss instances of piracy,
            where DIFFERENT BOATS/SHIPS have been illegally taken control of or boarded.
        </div>
            After each search task, you will be asked to recall what BOATS/SHIPS you
        found that were involved in acts of piracy --- followed by a series of short survey questions
        asking you about your search experience and the search system.

        <p>

        The HIT will take approximately 80 minutes.

        </p>
