        <h1> Practice Task</h1></p>


        <p> In order to get acquainted with the search system and newspaper database,
            we would like you to practice for a couple of minutes using the system to undertake a task similar to those
            you will need to undertake. Below is a description of the system.
        </p>

         <h2><b>The Search System and Search Task</b></h2>
    <p>The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1.8 million newspaper articles from the
            <em>New York Times</em>. The articles within the database range from 1987 to 2007.
        The search system you'll be using looks similar to a web search
            engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each search task, you'll be given a topic (like the one shown below).
        </p>
    <p>
        You will be able to enter queries and look at results, just like you would in a normal search engine.
    </p>

        <p>When you view a document which contains a relevant example, then you can click the
            <b>Bookmark</b> button to save it.</p>

        <p>If you need to remind yourself of the search task, you will be able to click the <b>show task</b>.</p>

        <p>Once you find a number of relevant examples, you can click <b>end task</b>
            to proceed, otherwise the system will automatically time out after about 8 minutes.</p>

 <div id="taskbox">
            <p>{% autoescape off %} {{ taskdescription }} {% endautoescape %} </p>
        </div>



    <h2><b>Goal</b></h2>
       <p> <b>Your goal is to find and save several relevant and different examples for each topic </b>
        </p>

<p>
        After searching, you will be asked to list as many examples as possible that you have just found.

        </p>



    <hr/>



        <p>To get familiar with the system, we would like you to:
        <ul>
            <li> Select "Show Task" to remind you what the topic of the search task is.</li>
            <li> Search for documents about this topic by entering queries. </li>
            <li> Try entering a few different queries.</li>
            <li> Save a document by bookmarking it.</li>
            <li> Scroll down to click on the "Next" page button, and</li>
            <li> Review your list of documents by selecting "View Saved".</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    </div>


    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p>Click Next to start the practice task.</p>
        <hr/>
        <div class="surveySubmitButton nextButton">
        <a class="nextButton" href="{% url 'treconomics:next' %}">
            <button class="button nextButton" type="next"> Next</button>
        </a>
    </div>
